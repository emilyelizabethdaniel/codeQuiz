# codeQuiz

## Make a quiz about coding using html, css and js
I built this quiz by making an html with id's that I could reference with my js. I then styled it with css and with js I made the questions and text appear and dissapear. With Js by clicking the buttons it starts the timer, and the answers to the questions bring on the next question and also check to see if the answer is correct or incorrect. when the quiz is either completed or the timer runs out, the final score is shown (the time left) if the user answers a question wrong 10 seconds is subtracted from their timer. There is a high score linked html, what records the score and the user intials using local storage.
